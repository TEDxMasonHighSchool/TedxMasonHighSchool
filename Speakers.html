				"Like a stone dropped into a pond, TEDx serves as a catalyst for individuals <br>who create waves in our community and beyond. Our theme, “Ripples,” <br>represents transformative ideas each speaker and attendee brings to our <br>event. Rapidly advancing technological developments in AI, aviation, and <br>biotechnology have fueled humanity to greater heights. With these new <br>advances, however, we also must redefine societal norms and age-old values <br>of justice and failure. In this conference, we seek to provide a platform for <br>advancing transformative ideas  so we can spread ripples in our society. "
